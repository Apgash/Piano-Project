# Piano Player Web App

Welcome to the **Piano Player Web App**! This is an interactive piano application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/). Users can play notes on a virtual piano, record the sequence, and replay the stored notes. The application uses **localStorage** to save played notes and offers a clear function to reset the sequence.

## Installation

### Option 1: Directly Open in Browser
1. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/piano-player-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder where the files are stored.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### Option 2: Serve Locally
If you want to serve the app locally using a web server, you can use tools like `Live Server` for Visual Studio Code or any other lightweight web server.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/piano-player-app.git
   ```
2. Open the folder in a code editor.
3. Run a local server using a tool like `Live Server` or `http-server`.

### Dependencies

The project relies on two external libraries loaded from CDNs:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://cdn.tailwindcss.com)
- [Tone.js](https://unpkg.com/tone)

These are automatically loaded when you open the `index.html` file, so no additional installation is required.

## Usage

1. **Playing the Piano**: 
   - Click on the piano keys to play individual notes. Each key corresponds to a musical note (e.g., `C4`, `D#4`).
   - As you play, the notes will be displayed on the screen.
   
2. **Recording Notes**: 
   - Every note you play will be stored in your browser's local storage.
   - The notes will persist across page reloads and will automatically be displayed when you revisit the page.

3. **Play Stored Notes**: 
   - Click the **Play** button to play back all the notes you've played in the sequence they were recorded.

4. **Clear Notes**: 
   - Click the **Clear** button to reset the notes and clear local storage.

## Local Storage

This web app uses the browser's `localStorage` to store the sequence of notes you play. The stored data persists across sessions, meaning that even if you close the browser, your played notes will still be available when you reopen the app.

- `playedNotes`: Stores the array of played notes (e.g., `["C4", "D#4", "E4"]`).
- The **Clear** button will remove all the stored notes from local storage.
